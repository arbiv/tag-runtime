## Key Developments

* The **OpenSource Initiative** is working out what OpenSource AI means and working on a [definition](https://opensource.org/deepdive)

* [Generative AI Commons](https://genaicommons.org/) and the [Model Openness Framework (MOF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13784):The model openess framework aims to counter "openwashing" by ensuring that open-source AI truly adheres to the principles of open-source and open access. Learn about the MOF here, and the Generative AI commons initiatives is working to formalize this process by tracking open source model and making sure they adhere to the MOF.

* [CNCF Cloud Native Maturity Model](https://maturitymodel.cncf.io/): The team is working to incorporate Cloud Native AI as part of the maturity model.

* Upcoming writeups on challenges Cloud Native AI scheduling as well as introductions to deploy AI on Kubernetes.
* The CNAI Landscape is one step away from the merge. A preview is available [here](https://landscape.cncf.io/?overlay-data=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FRX-M%2Flandscape%2Fmaster%2Flandscape.yml&overlay-logos=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FRX-M%2Flandscape%2Fmaster%2Fhosted_logos&group=cnai).
