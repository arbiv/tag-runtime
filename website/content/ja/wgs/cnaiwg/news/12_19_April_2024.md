## Key Developments

### **1. WG Serving Proposal in Kubernetes Community**

The Kubernetes community has introduced a new proposal for a Working Group (WG) Serving to enhance serving capabilities within the ecosystem. The [proposal (#7823)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7823) involves collaboration across multiple SIGs including apps, architecture, node, scheduling, and autoscaling. This broad involvement indicates its potential wide-reaching impact on Kubernetes.

### **2. Advancement & Innovations in CNCF AI Technologies**

- The **OpenTelemetry community** has merged the [first PR](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/pull/825) for defining semantic conventions for Large Language Models (LLMs). This initiative is part of a broader effort by the otel-llm-semconv-wg to standardize and monitor AI systems, paving the way for future AI-related telemetry enhancements.
- **Lingo Project**: Introduced in the [TAG-Runtime meeting](https://youtu.be/IOSG_GRwRII), this project focuses on a lightweight ML model proxy and autoscaler specifically designed for Kubernetes, underscoring the ongoing integration of machine learning with cloud-native infrastructure.
- The **Open Policy Agent** community demoed a proposed experimental AI/LLM engine :sparkles: (in addition to CEL and Rego engines) in the :opa: Gatekeeper community call that would simplify policy writing. [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKGrVV7Xv7Q) for those interested and just the demo [here](https://asciinema.org/a/QTBEBp8l0vE5wgD9yGgxE3mnV).
- **OPEA: Ecosystem Orchestration for GenAI Adoption**: OPEA is an ecosystem orchestration framework that aims to integrate performant GenAI technologies and workflows, enabling faster GenAI adoption and delivering business value.

### **3. CNCF Community Activities**

- **CNAI Mission/Vision**: To clarify the shared understanding of the group's scope, goals, and mission, and initiatives, a draft [strategy document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ywdStd1l6sVJbdj3HWMj6X8vWzj2eSg9SZCkQD6noY/edit) was created, as well as a new cloud native [AI github project](https://github.com/orgs/cncf/projects/38) to track the work and highlight progress.
- **CNCF Youtube Summarizer Project**: Discussed in recent community calls, this project [aims to use AI to enhance content accessibility and summarization on CNCF’s YouTube channel](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lkdgG22KMxXuc582_CtNBgfVcJTNxf1diXXhTXNy8qg/edit?usp=sharing).
- **Kubernetes Book Club**: The community has begun exploring the book "Machine Learning on Kubernetes", adapting its content to better fit current trends and the specific needs of the community.
- **Cloud Native AI Landscape**: progress made on getting a [PoC](https://rx-m.github.io/cnai-landscape/) for a cloud native AI landscape up and running, contributions are welcome.

## Conclusion

This week has been bustling with activity, highlighting the CNCF's AI community's ongoing efforts to integrate AI into the cloud native landscape. These developments are geared towards building a robust ecosystem equipped to handle the future demands of AI. Stay tuned for more updates as these projects progress and continue to shape the landscape.
