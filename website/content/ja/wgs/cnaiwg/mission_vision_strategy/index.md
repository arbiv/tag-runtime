In recent years, the landscape of AI workloads has become more diverse, partly driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models and the proliferation of augmented retrieval use cases. This transformative landscape has prompted researchers and industry professionals to explore and develop approaches for effectively addressing the specific needs of these workloads.  However, adopting AI workloads is still hindered by the absence of a unified approach, best practices, shared knowledge, and suitable tools to get the job done, which remains an obstacle to adopting AI at scale.

## FAQs

### How is CNAI different from other CNCF and AI-related WGs/Tags?  {#how-is-cnai-different-from-other-cncf-and-ai-related-wgs-tags}

The CNAI working group focuses on the interconnection between AI applications and cloud-native technologies. Unlike other working groups that may focus solely on solving specific technical problems in a specific context (e.g, serving/batch), CNAI explores broader integration challenges and opportunities to streamline AI workloads on top of the cloud-native ecosystem. This can range from **technical/functional** concerns (e.g., reference architecture, best practices, how-tos, etc.)  to **business and governance** concerns (e.g., ROI, responsible deployments, trust, etc). The artifacts produced are not necessarily APIs or inherently new projects. Instead, they focus on the interplay between existing projects, concepts, and APIs to solve existing use cases and business concerns.

Let’s take **_wg-batch_** as an example or **sig-batch** (Kubernetes specific). Technically, not all batch workloads are AI workloads. AI is a use case where batching makes sense, especially with training, for example. In that case, CNAI emphasizes the nuanced requirements of AI workloads in a cloud-native context. While both groups might explore scheduling, CNAI looks at how to tailor these solutions specifically for AI applications. For instance, AI model training, a typical batch workload, requires handling large volumes of data and intensive computation cycles efficiently CNAI would explore how existing cloud-native technologies and Kubernetes can be adapted or extended to meet these demands effectively, focusing on aspects like GPU allocation, network optimization, and persistent storage management tailored for AI, which go beyond general batch processing. Also, CNAI would touch on benefits/tradeoffs to provide best practices that will be especially useful for decision makers.

### What is the relationship between the [AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai/) and CNAI?  {#what-is-the-relationship-between-the-ai-alliance-and-cnai}

The AI Alliance and Cloud Native AI (CNAI) operate with distinct but complementary missions within the AI ecosystem. The AI Alliance is focused on fostering **open innovation and collaboration across the AI technology landscape**, aiming to accelerate development and ensure **safety**, **security**, and **trust** in AI technologies. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">It emphasizes collaboration over standardization</span> and engages in a broad range of activities from education to policy advocacy.

On the other hand, CNAI concentrates on integrating AI into and for cloud-native environments and ecosystems, providing the tooling, **frameworks**, **reference architectures**, and **best practices** necessary for **effective, scalable, and secure AI deployments within these specific infrastructures**.

While the AI Alliance creates a broad collaborative network across multiple AI focus areas, CNAI targets the specific technical needs of deploying AI in/with/for cloud-native architectures and enhancing user experience for cloud native AI tooling, making their missions complementary in advancing the overall AI field.

### What is the relationship between the [OPEA](https://opea.dev/) and CNAI?  {#what-is-the-relationship-between-the-opea-and-cnai}

OPEA and CNAI are **complementary** in their objectives towards the AI landscape. OPEA offers a reference architecture and blueprints detailing the key building blocks for building LLM and Generative AI applications, prioritizing performance, feature completeness, trustworthiness, and enterprise grade readiness. CNAI on the other hand, could leverage OPEA’s frameworks and AI application architectures to provide an end to end guidance for deploying those generative AI architectures using cloud-native tooling and experience.

CNAI’s mission is rooted in enabling the integration of AI with and for the cloud native ecosystem to enable builders to produce best in class products and services using standardized tooling and shared knowledge. This involves making sure architectures such as the ones produced by OPEA can be effectively deployed and scaled using cloud native technologies.
